#Base types
> Underlying every R object is a C `struct` that describes how that object is stored in memory. 
> 
> 1. contents of the object
> 2. info for memory management
> 3. a type

> only the R core team can create new types in this category

#S3
> Most objects that you encounter are S3 objects.

> In S3, methods belong to functions, called generic functions

###define class and creating objects
```{r}
foo <- structure( list(), class ='foo')
class(foo)
```
