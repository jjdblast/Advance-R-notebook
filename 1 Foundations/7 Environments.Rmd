> Environment has reference semantics -> When you modify a binding in an environment, the environment is not copied; it’s modified in place.

#Basics
> The job of an environment is to associate as set of names to a set of values.

This is actully a function, a dictionary, an one level deep relationship.

> Every environment has a parent, another environment. The parent is used to implement lexical scoping: if a name is not found in an environment, then R will look in its parent (and so on). Only one environment doesn’t have a parent: the empty environment.

> an environment is similar to a list, with four important exceptions:
>
> 1. Every object in an environment has a unique name.
> 2. The objects in an environment are not ordered (i.e., it doesn’t make sense to ask what the first object in an environment is).
> 3. An environment has a parent.
> 4. Environments have reference semantics.

###4 special environments
1. `globalenv()`, env in which you normally work
2. `baseenv()`, env of base package, parent = empty
3. `emptyenv()`, ultimate ancestor of all env
4. `environment()`, current env

###search path
![](../pictures/search_path.png)

###create env
```{r}
e <- new.env()
parent.env(e) # see parent env
ls(e) # list objects of this env
```

###create and modify bindings
```{r}
e$a <- 1
e$b <- 2
ls(e)
ls.str(e) # show str of every object in this env
```

###remove bindings
```{r}
e$a <- NULL # won't remove the binding, just map a to NULL
rm('a', envir = e) # this is what you want
```

###check in object's existance
```{r}
x <- 2 # in global
exists("x", envir = e, inherits = FALSE) # inherits = F won't look up to global
```

###compare env
```{r}
identical(globalenv(), environment())
```
